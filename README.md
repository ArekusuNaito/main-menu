# [Main Menu]

## Motivation

- To improve my knowledge on React and Electron
- To create an app to help with daily activities.
- To help improve discipline on yourself and tracking your own stuff, made by you.
- Aims to create a Main Menu like a game, where you can see your recipes, archives, tools but **for your daily life**.

## Notes

- This is just a prototype, this might not be the best code (as I'm learning along the way),  I hope that multiple iterations help this app grow.
- A big thanks to [alexakasanjeev](https://github.com/alexakasanjeev) for his [electron-react simple boilerplate.](https://github.com/alexakasanjeev/electron-react-quick-start)
